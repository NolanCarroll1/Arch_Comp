00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:06.440
hi and thank you for choosing Carol

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:10.040
architecture here at Carol architecture

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:13.400
we pride ourselves on being a long list

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.600
of descendants of hardworking

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:20.199
individuals we all started back all the

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:23.199
way back in the 1800s when my great

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:25.920
great grandfather Edgar came across the

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:28.720
seas from Denmark here in the United

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.759
States he didn't know so much as the

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.000
names of the tools he was using using in

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:36.040
English but what he did know how to do

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.120
was make things that brought people

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.399
together he knew how to work hard here

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.480
at Carol architecture we uphold that

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.000
tradition in trying to make places where

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:51.440
you and your descendants can gather for

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.440
generations to come in Comfort
